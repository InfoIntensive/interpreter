# Cequel Interpreter Library

Cequel's purpose is to immitate the pseudocode programming language commonly used in Romanian high schools to introduce students to the fundamentals of programming in their 9th-grade curriculum. This interpreter library stands as the core of the language used in both the [windows executable project](https://github.com/InfoIntensive/interpreter-exec) as well as the API for the InfoIntensive learning platform, making it an invaluable tool for both students and educators alike.

## Features
- **Full Interpreter**: This interpreter fully supports the pseudocode language, allowing you to execute code seamlessly.
- **Educational Tool**: Whether you're a student learning programming for the first time or an educator teaching the basics, the Cequel Interpreter provides a practical way to experiment with the pseudocode taught in romanian 9th grade programming classes.
